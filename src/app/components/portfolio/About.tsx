          Hi, I’m Vedant Thanekar, a final-year Information Technology student
          who enjoys building systems, from backend APIs and data pipelines to
          production deployments. I’ve worked on full-stack and backend projects
          involving ETL pipelines, relational databases, and cloud
          infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-8">
          Apart from tech, I am also interested in Films, TV shows. I love
          telling stories, I also write sometimes. Books are a big part of how I
          think and feel about the world. What drives me the most is curiosity.
          I like learning how things are made, whether I&apos;m writing, reading
          or coding, I always love chasing that feeling.
        </p>
